**(In Lenox Hill Hospital, after surgery,
my mother said the sirens sounded like the
elephants of Mihiragula when his men drove
them off cliffs in the Pir Panjal Range.)**

*- Agha Shahid Ali*

Every Tuesday evening, I exit the 14th Street subway and confront the squat, oblong silhouette of Lenox Health, the West Village outpost of Lenox Hill Hospital. The first time I saw it, the building caught me by surprise—not for its beauty, but for what it stirred: the memory of a poem titled *Lenox Hill* by Agha Shahid Ali, Kashmir's most celebrated poet. Shahid's mother, for him the living embodiment of all Kashmir, passed away at the Lenox Hill Hospital on 77th Street. Both buildings are unremarkable, plain to the eye. Yet, it is our fantasies that give life to objects. Years ago, I read a piece in *Scroll* about Shahid and shortly after found his poem. Never did I think I would one day stumble upon the hospital system that lent its name to his elegy. In its best moments, New York City is a place where stories leap from imagination to reality.

Shahid's dying mother, perhaps delirious, hears sirens and imagines elephants—creatures both ancient and strangely modern. Conflict and war in the Pir Panjal are equally ancient and modern. The mountain range sits at the foot of the Himalayas, running southeast to northwest, separating Jammu from the Kashmir Valley. The coming of the Huns under Mihirakula, the Durrani Afghans, the Sikh conquest, Dogra rule, and the apparently interminable India-Pakistan wars and skirmishes—the mountains have witnessed them all. Once again, air raid sirens have shattered the uneasy, watchful peace, and fighter jets fly over the mountain passes. Did the cries of those killed defending the Pir Panjal's heights over the centuries echo the screams of Mihirakula's elephants?

What kind of intoxication and hubris must engulf a man to drive his war elephants off a cliff for sport? It is a senseless act, violence as performative spectacle, revealing the depths of human malevolence. No wonder Shahid's mother conflates the screams of the elephants with New York's sirens—both hint at devastation, both portend suffering.

All winter, every Tuesday, I've arrived at the flashing red "Emergency" sign of Lenox Health and walked a little faster. Hospitals are places of healing, but also of death. As ambulances sweep down 7th Avenue, their sirens wailing, it becomes hard to shake off a sudden gloom—directed toward the doomed elephants, Shahid's troubled homeland, or the struggles of New York's multitudes.

Yet last Tuesday, with spring's arrival, the city's sirens and the hospital took on a different quality. The same sirens felt like harbingers of hope, heralding a season ripe with renewal's promise. One World Trade Center loomed in the distance— a symbol of resilience and rebirth, if there ever was one. I stopped and stared at Lenox Health, the same ugly shape now rendered gentler by a spring evening's warmth. After all, Mihirakula, his men, and his dynasty are forgotten, but elephants still roam the Himalayan foothills.
